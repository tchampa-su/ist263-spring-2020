    <p>
        My name is Timothy Champa, a Junior at Syracuse University who is Majoring in Information Management and technologies at the iSchool
        as well as Minoring in Computer Gaming at VPA. I'm currently playing on to go abroad to Florence, Italy for study abroad seeing the sites of Italy and learning about its history<br/>
        Some of my favorite hobbies include playing videogames, learning about history, hanging out with friends and generally relaxing at home.
