            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Hello my name is Timothy Champa, a student in Syracuse University, Majoring in the iSchool working with coding and understanding buisness management. I am also Minoring in Shaffer building under Computer Gaming where I also use coding to create interactive media and 3D animated shorts. It's a lot fun jumping back and forth from my Major and Minor but I want to talk about my Minor due to because of the creative aspects and design choices in my decisions.</p>

            <p>This Image is of work space of both my Major and Minor. I use several coding tools such as Visual Code Studio and a website called Open Processing. These coding tools have a varitey of uses and functions to create, for instance, VCS allows me to create websites using a coding language called HTML, while Openprocessing uses code to create interactive media like games or art based programs.</p>

            <p>This is the iSchool, the place that my Major is held, I learn how different technology can be and practice business management. For me, I love learning about the different parts of doing business management and seeing new ways to conduct managment in the work place</p>
