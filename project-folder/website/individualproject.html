I am also Minoring in Shaffer building under Computer Gaming where I also use coding to create interactive media and 3D animated shorts. It's a lot fun jumping back and forth from my Major and Minor but I want to talk about my Minor due to because of the creative aspects and design choices in my decisions.</p>
                <p>This Image is of work space of both my Major and Minor. I use several coding tools such as Visual Code Studio and a website called Open Processing. These coding tools have a varitey of uses and functions to create, for instance, VCS allows me to create websites using a coding language called HTML, while Openprocessing uses code to create interactive media like games or art based programs.</p>
