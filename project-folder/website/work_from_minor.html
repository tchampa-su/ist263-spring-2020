            <p>This image is from my still life project where we had to create a 3D space that represents our living habits and likes. The process of this project was to capture a semi-example of what your living space would be like, like what would you do, what kind of objects would you be using, why are these objects here and give a detailed background of the room. For me this was based off my old house where I would have my laptop and iPhone on me at all times while doing homework or having a snack.</p>

            <p>Heres another shot of the still life project where I show a bit more off and show a different angle to it. I want to go more the use of the maya program here. Maya lets you create scenes and animations in one program. So say I want to animate a model in here I could and make it an animation where someone is living here, thats one of the many possibilities with the Maya tool and how it can be used.</p>

            <p>One of my favorite projects was when we create fictional creature. We would design the creature and give a reason why its designed like it is, why we designed it, why in this landscape or area and tell a story about it. For me I modeled it after a creature from a videogame and I gave the backstory of it ran away from its habitat due to one of its predators. It has been one of my favorite projects due to it being a creative what we did and how we did it.</p>

            <p>Here is a still from an animation project in which we used a rigged model to move a character and create a 10-20 second reel on what hes doing, the story behind it and have fun with it. This was also fun due to how we can use the model however we wanted and to create scenarios that were ever changing. This was part of my animation class in VPA during this semester and I had a lot of fun with it and showed me what I can do with these animation tools and how I can create different stories with just one character</p>
